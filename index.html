                                    <p>If you need to get a quick start on writing terms and conditions, you can use the information found in this article to jump-start the legal side of your official website. We will provide you with information on what terms and conditions are, and why website owners need it, along with the terms and conditions template and a few examples.</p>
                                    <p>A few of the facts stated below deserve your undivided attention. First, make sure to check law requirements and if they apply in the country where you are from and what you need to include in the terms and conditions when you are using them. Second, make sure to place them in the right spot on your website in order to make them legally binding.</p>
                                    <p>Without further ado, let's take a closer look at terms and conditions.</p>
                                    <h2>What is a terms and conditions agreement?</h2>
                                    <p>In legal terms, terms and conditions are the same as terms of service and terms of use. People very often use the following abbreviations: ToS and ToU. In a legal sense, terms and conditions is a form of an agreement or contract. This document can contain standards, specifications, rules, requirements, provisions, and arrangements. For some purposes, the terms and conditions can be used as a plain disclaimer to notify the website visitors.</p>
                                    <p>It is important not to confuse it with the End-User License Agreement (EULA). EULA is used for desktop software that may or may not require a server connection to run. If you have a mobile app or if you offer services through your website, you will need to have ToS in place.</p>
                                    <p>On many websites today, rules and guidelines specified in the terms and conditions have to be agreed on by website visitors, so that the user may continue using the website in question. In this scenario, the website is a company and the user is the person who visits it. Terms and conditions serve as a legal contract between these two.</p>
                                    <p>Terms and conditions have to be set up by you. Since your website and/or service you provide may differ from others on the market, you can use the terms and conditions Template as a reference point. But, in the end, you will have to specify rules and guidelines for your website visitors to follow. This way, you will have a legal agreement and hold the rights to practice measures specified in the terms and conditions, if a visitor abuses the website and its content.</p>
                                    <p>Terms and conditions can be used in different business models offering a wide range of services:</p>
                                    <ul><li>E-commerce websites</li><li>Product catalog and business card websites</li><li>Online blogs running on WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and similar platforms</li><li>Software as a Service Applications (SASS)</li><li>Mobile Apps (iPhone, iOS, Android)</li><li>Web apps (Facebook, Twitter, etc)</li></ul>
                                    <h2>Why do website owners and app developers need it?</h2>
                                    <p>Now that we have established that website owners and mobile application developers need the terms and conditions as a set of rules users have to abide by in order to use the website or app, the question "Why?" remains unanswered. Here are several compelling reasons why website owners need terms and conditions:</p>
                                    <h3>Prevent abuses</h3>
                                    <p>Since the terms and conditions act as a legally binding contract, you will be able to take actions when users violate rules and guidelines provided in this document. This applies to abusive actions done by website visitors or mobile app users, such as posting or sharing defamatory content, spamming other users, using harmful language, etc.</p>
                                    <h3>Protect your content</h3>
                                    <p>Everything you create and post on your website or app, starting from the logo and images to blog posts and the design of the website makes you the owner of it. You can use terms and conditions to insert the intellectual property clause and inform the website visitors that you are the owner of the content and that it is <a href="https://www.copyrighted.com/blog/copyright-faq">protected by copyright</a> laws.</p>
                                    <h3>Ban users and terminate accounts</h3>
                                    <p>In some cases, even when you inform the users about the rules and guidelines, you won't be able to prevent abuses. When you specify a Termination or Ban clause in the terms and conditions, you will be able to terminate users accounts and ban them based on their activity.</p>
                                    <h3>Set the governing law</h3>
                                    <p>Website owners usually use terms and conditions to specify the governing law. Informing the users about the specific legal boundaries.</p>
                                    <h3>Limit liability</h3>
                                    <p>Terms and conditions can be used as a sort of disclaimer to inform the website visitors about specific content found on the website and <a href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/blog/limitation-of-liability-clause">limit the website owner's liability</a> in case the use of the content results in some negative effect to the user.</p>
                                    <h3>Cancel orders</h3>
                                    <p>Terms and conditions on an eCommerce website can be really useful. For instance, if you find out that some price was incorrect, you can cancel that order without facing any consequences. As long as you specify the specific circumstances in which you can take a specific action, you will stay on the legal side of things.</p>
                                    <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
                                    <p>If you collect any of website user's data, you are obligated to inform them about this. You also have to outline how you will use this collected data. You can add a <a href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/blog/what-is-privacy-policy">privacy policy</a> section to the terms and conditions, or which is more common, place it on its own page separately from the terms and conditions agreement.</p>
                                    <h2>Law requirements in different countries</h2>
                                    <p>Unlike privacy policy, posting terms and conditions on a website or mobile app is not required by law in many countries in the world. There are some countries though that explicitly require this if a business runs an online shop, eCommerce website, or if it offers services through a mobile app.</p>
                                    <p>In Australia, for instance, you are required by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://consumerlaw.gov.au" target="_blank">Australian Consumer Law</a> to clearly describe your business standards and provide terms and conditions on your eCommerce website. In Australia, the terms and conditions have to include directions on how visitors can use a website, what is forbidden, and a short liability disclaimer. Terms and conditions found on websites of businesses based in this country have to cover:</p>
                                    <ul><li>Privacy policy</li><li>Disclaimer</li><li>Returns and Refunds, as well as delivery of goods policy</li><li>Australian consumer law and consumer guarantees</li><li>User's rights to use the website in question</li></ul>
                                    <p>For a business that bases its shops online, having terms and conditions is defiantly a must. But this is not exclusively imposed by a government of a country the business is situated in. As a matter of fact, credit card operators require eCommerce website owners to have terms and conditions, as well as a privacy policy before they let them use credit card processing services.</p>
                                    <figure><img src="https://www.websitepolicies.com/uploads/7/5/6/9/tnVKW8dqC48KGcdvrJl3.jpg" data-image="120" width="1200" height="430" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Terms and conditions" title="Terms and conditions"></figure>
                                    <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ftc.gov" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">World's Federal Trade Commission</a> has few regulations regarding terms and conditions and online privacy protection. For instance, if a company has a website that targets an audience that is under 13 years old, it has to be compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
                                    <p>In terms and conditions agreements it is incredibly important to define a <a href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/blog/governing-law-clause">governing law</a>. The governing law clause clearly states which laws and rules govern the agreement. This is the first clause interested parties look for in case legal issues arise.</p>
                                    <h2>What to include in terms and conditions?</h2>
                                    <p>In order to cover all legal grounds, writing the terms and conditions has to be taken seriously. Depending on the service or content you provide to your users, you can consider including the following in your custom-tailored terms and conditions agreement (not necessarily in this order):</p>
                                    <h3>Limitations clause</h3>
                                    <p>A clause where you specify the limits to what the users can do. In this section, you inform website visitors or app users that upon agreeing on using it, they are also agreeing to the other things. Website owners usually state negative and unwanted uses, the so-called prohibited activities.</p>
                                    <h3>Intellectual property clause</h3>
                                    <p>Intellectual property disclosure usually informs website visitors and/or app users that the provided content is the website owners property. This is a great place to state which content is protected by (international) copyright laws.</p>
                                    <h3>Content clause</h3>
                                    <p>The content clause is pretty common on websites that have a blog section open for contributors, or any kind of content uploading and sharing features. In the content clause, the website owner can inform visitors that they own the rights to the content they have created, even though it is public and accessible to other visitors. In this clause, you also inform the users that upon uploading, you might share this content and make it accessible to anyone else.</p>
                                    <h3>Termination clause</h3>
                                    <p>User ban and account termination clause should always be included in terms and conditions if there is a user/visitor behavior limitation clause. In this clause, the website owner informs users that their accounts can be terminated if they violate any of the rules and guidelines regarding the use of the website.</p>
                                    <h3>Service availability clause</h3>
                                    <p>If you are providing service via your website, this clause is really important. Big online service providers such as Apple clearly state in this clause that iTunes services can be canceled at any time without notifying users and that they do not guarantee that the service will be accessible around the clock.</p>
                                    <h3>Governing law clause</h3>
                                    <p>Terms and conditions is an agreement. In this clause, website owners inform visitors which laws govern the agreement. Usually, these laws are laws of the state where the company's headquarters are located or state/country from which the company operates.</p>
                                    <h3>Linking to other websites clause</h3>
                                    <p>If you have links to other websites on your website, including <a href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/blog/affiliate-links-disclosure">affiliate links</a>, it is important to inform users that you are not responsible for the content of the websites that the links on your website lead to. You can state here that visitors are responsible for reading 3rd party websites' privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>
                                    <h2>Terms and conditions examples</h2>
                                    <p>Here are some examples of terms and conditions agreement of the most popular websites.</p>
                                    <h3>Google</h3>
                                    <p>Google is the leader among the online service providers. As such, this company decided to provide Terms and Policies for each of their services. We simply don't have space here to go through them all. Here is just one example of Google+ Custom URLs Terms of Use:</p>
                                    <figure><img src="https://www.websitepolicies.com/uploads/9/4/3/7/qnRebchRfEvs09y682JZ.png" data-image="77" width="648" height="270" alt="Google+ Terms of use example" title="Google+ Terms of use example" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></figure>
                                    <h3>YouTube</h3>
                                    <p>YouTube has an incredibly high number of visitors who come by to watch videos and users who film, create and upload videos. Their terms and conditions is quite long but written in an impeccable fashion. They divide this agreement into several sections.</p>
                                    <p>Right at the start visitors can get informed about what they are accepting, followed by service, user accounts, general use, permissions and restrictions, use of the content, conduct, account termination policy, digital millennium copyright act, warranty disclaimer, limitation of liability, indemnity, assignment, and other general clauses.</p>
                                    <p>They have a well-written Ability to Accept Terms of Service, which you can see below:</p>
                                    <figure><img src="https://www.websitepolicies.com/uploads/0/1/1/6/LvyoC2TMygVYueqlcfmK.png" data-image="78" width="720" height="140" alt="YouTube ability to accept terms of service clause" title="YouTube ability to accept terms of service clause" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></figure>
                                    <h3>Amazon</h3>
                                    <p>Amazon has quickly become a synonym for online purchasing. Today Amazon is so much more, but let's stick to the eCommerce side of Amazon's operations. This company provides extensive terms and conditions agreement, covering all possible scenarios. For the purpose of this article, I've decided to share with you the limitations clause of their shipping and delivery terms and conditions agreement.</p>
                                    <figure><img src="https://www.websitepolicies.com/uploads/2/5/8/6/OtBwOYJHWVQU44PJ1Qtb.png" data-image="79" width="611" height="204" alt="Amazon terms and conditions limitations clause" title="Amazon terms and conditions limitations clause" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></figure>
                                    <h2>Where to display terms and conditions?</h2>
                                    <p>Two most common ways to display terms and conditions are browse-wrap and clickwrap.</p>
                                    <p>A browsewrap agreement is the one that is displayed in the footer of the web page. Website owners often opt for this type, because it doesn't have an impact on the website design and user experience.</p>
                                    <figure><img src="https://www.websitepolicies.com/uploads/4/2/1/6/TlmgnRM8qYLDBExjbAXa.png" data-image="80" width="724" height="39" alt="Terms and conditions browse-wrap example" title="Terms and conditions browse-wrap example" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></figure>
                                    <p>A clickwrap agreement is when you place full terms and conditions, available on a user's demand, in an obvious spot. Lightbox beside the terms and conditions on web pages where users have to take action is also a pretty common solution.</p>
                                    <figure><img src="https://www.websitepolicies.com/uploads/5/7/1/6/NuXp7NXjqYWe4ytjrfJe.png" data-image="81" width="374" height="164" alt="Terms and conditions click-wrap example" title="Terms and conditions click-wrap example" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></figure>
                                    <h2>How to enforce terms and conditions?</h2>
                                    <p>It is one thing to display the terms and conditions agreement, but another to make it enforceable. Why is it important to make it enforceable? In case you end up in court, you will have to prove that the website visitor was informed about the terms and conditions and despite it, he has performed an action that resulted in, for example, account termination.</p>
                                    <p>The best way to make the terms and conditions enforceable it to force a website visitor or mobile app user to perform an action which confirms that they have read terms and conditions. We have mentioned Browse-wrap agreements in the section above. These are not suitable for this purpose because they are usually located in the footer of the website, containing the link to the terms and conditions.</p>
                                    <p>In order to enforce it, a clickwrap agreement is a much better solution. Providing proper notice to visitors about legal agreements before they perform an action is called a clickwrap agreement. For instance, before subscribing to an email list or for news updates, registering an account, completing a purchase, etc.</p>
                                    <h2>Sample free terms and conditions template</h2>
                                    <p>This generic terms and conditions template will help you see how everything we talked about so far comes together to form a legal agreement. Keep in mind that this is just an example terms and conditions template and does not cover many of the important topics.</p>
